## Running on Machine Locally

### Languages
```
choco install golang
choco install nodejs
choco install protoc

```

* Notice about PBs
1. PBs and .proto files are used to define messaging and the functions utilized in a GRPC service. 

2. The PB file is generated by running the below command in the communicating service's language. It can then be imported, registered to a GRPC server, and then invoked from the client.

```
protoc --go_out=$CUR_DIR/ blog.proto
```

### Next.js UI
```
cd portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Infrastructure
```
choco install awscli
choco install docker
choco install terraform
choco install kubernetes-cli
choco install kubernetes-helm
choco install minikube


docker build --tag service-portfolio .
docker run -p 9100:9100 service-portfolio
```

### Swagger

### Linter
Linting is utilized to maintain a safe, readable, and consistent coding standard throughout the services.

- golangci-lint is used as the primary linter for the go services as it has many different types of linters avaiable.

```

```
