## Local Setup

### Languages
```
choco install golang
choco install nodejs
choco install protoc

```

* Notice about PBs
1. PBs and .proto files are used to define messaging and the functions utilized in a GRPC service. 

2. The PB file is generated by running the below command in the communicating service's language. It can then be imported, registered to a GRPC server, and then invoked from the client.

```
protoc --go_out=$CUR_DIR/ blog.proto
```

### Next.js UI
```
cd portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```
